//The 3 type primitives most used in JavaScript are number, boolean and string
//There are many more to uncover in TypeScript but for now let's see how to ASSIGN a type to a variable

//If we want this variable to be specifically a number we can just follow it with the : number notation
let age: number = 20;

//Were we to assign a value that is a different type like a string, there would be an error
// let date: number = "1997";

//We can do the same with strings
let hello: string = "world";

//And booleans
let value: boolean = true;
