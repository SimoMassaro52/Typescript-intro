To actually run our TypeScript code and make it recognised by the browser we need a compiler that will covert it correctly into readable JS

To add Typescript to our project we need node.js and npm
First run: 
npm i typescript -save-dev

Then we add a tsconfig.json file by running
npx tsc --init

To transpile a code file to vanilla JS, we run
tsc filename.ts


It's handy to install the TypeScript compiler globally through:
npm install -g typescript

Check the version with:
tsc --version

It is strongly reccommended when learning TypeScript to enable on-hover VSCode prompts by 
going into file > preferences > settings and typing editor.hover.enable and ticking the checkbox
